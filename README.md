## Introduction
In the recent times, the prevalence of people with diabetes is proliferating, which has posed a formidable challenge to the global healthcare system. To remedy this situation, innovative approaches are necessary to improve the capability of prediction and management this kind of disease. Thus, in this project, I would like to build a Machine Learning model to forecast diabetes, as well as analyze in depth how factocs affect the likelihood of devlopment of disease, so that the doctors can take timely and appropriate measures to prevent and treat the disease effectively.
